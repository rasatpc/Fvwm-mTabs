# Fvwm-mTabs
Fvwm-mTabs is a simplified version of KISe and myExt that uses FvwmTabs. It is a generic tabbing module for FVWM that was included in FVWM2. It can swallow any fvwm window and treat it as a tab in a tab-manager window.

# Main features:
* Desk Icons include:
	Iconified Thumbnails, Full-Screen Maximize, Windows Overview,
	Tiling and Tabs.

* Tab managers:
	Store any number of windows, each in its own tab.
	AutoSwallow automatically moves applications to a specific tab
	when they create windows. A powerful feature when combined
	with AutoMoveWindows, which moves apps and tabs to a specific
	desk/page.

* Icon/Application Panel.
* Task Panel.
* XDG menu.
* Day/Time Panel.
* 4-button Window Title Bar.
* Auto Move Windows.
* Page Indicator.
* Tiled and scalable wallpaper features.
* Window focus on all desks and pages.

Tested on Fvwm3 and Fvwm2

# HOW TO INSTALL

Download:

* https://github.com/rasatpc/Fvwm-mTabs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

Extract and copy subfolders to ~/.fvwm

When Fvwm is loaded for the first time, .fvwm/config creates a subsystem file (userExt.sys) that reads the scripts and runs the system.

* Requirements & dependencies read setup/INSTALL.md
