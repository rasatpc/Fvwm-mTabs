FVWM-mTabs (ver. 0.9)

The configs are organized into folders and loaded in same sequence as the default Fvwm.

.fvwm/core/
	1Functions
	2Styles
	3Colorsets
	4Menus
	5Bindings
	6Decor
	7Modules

To add and make changes to the core and create your own without being overwritten by new updates, it includes one additional user folder and system file:

.fvwm/user and .fvwm/userExt.sys -- user folder and a file for reading the core and user configs.

This structure aids in maintaining, debugging, and developing new functions, decor, and modules.

To manage wallpapers, including installation and configuration, there are two folders:

.fvwm/images
.fvwm/setup

Configs with a folder includes readme.txt that describes how to install it and where to add it in .fvwm/userExt.sys.

Preloaded settings are changed in userExt.sys, such as EdgeScroll, fonts, geometry, mouse click, and window placement.

To make changes, copy the entire folder to .fvwm/user. For example, .fvwm/core/7Modules/SimpleButton, and modify the read line in userExt.sys.

"Read $[CORE_DIR]/7Modules/SimpleButton/simpleB.sys" to
"Read $[USER_DIR]/SimpleButton/simpleB.sysf"
(with variable $[USER_DIR])

Note: Three configs are automatically copied to .fvwm/user at first load.

AutoMoveWin
TMenu
SimpleButton

To edit, click on lable in the menu (left-click) <System>.
